# the goal of this lab is to grasp the concept of object oriented programming


# Our prject is on blockchain technology 
# when doing good research the number 1 rule in my opinion is to stay away from wikipedia because it can be edited by random people and you cannot be sure if what you're reading is true or not. The way we found our sources was google scholar.
# I learned about how blockchain technology is responsibe for private and completely secure currency transactions. The main application used for this is bitcoin. I also learned that blockchain is still pretty new and is still being researched and there are still limitations that scientist and researchers are trying to overcome.
